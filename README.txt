Project Name: To Do List

Hello and welcome to my project, To Do List. This is still a work in progress and not the final version.

For its functionality and design, I have used jQuery, AJAX requests, and MDB5. The tasks are imported from a local JSON file and displayed in a table. The search button allows users to search for specific keywords and only displays the rows that contain the keyword. Additionally, you can add a new task, edit existing tasks, and remove tasks as needed.

If you have any questions or feedback, I would be happy to hear from you. You can contact me at claudiuszidelo@yahoo.ro. Also, feel free to check out my personal LinkedIn and GitHub profiles in the footer.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project, and happy coding!
